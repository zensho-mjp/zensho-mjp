Hi, I'm a Master's IT student at UNamur, Belgium.

I'm mainly interested in UX experiences, and web development.
For that purpose, I'm currently teaching myself React, Node.js, and basically the MERN stack.
I'm using Academind.com for most of it, with an incredible teacher in the person of Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller!
